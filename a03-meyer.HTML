			<td> This model is deisgned to articulate the problem and design space more than your average model. Characterists of some of the best conceptual models is that it enables designers to refine their thinking and appear obvious/simple which makes the operations they support intuitive to use. </td>

			<td>  The conceptual model for the Xerox Star included the familiar knowledge of an average office space. The icons included on the screen were represented as papers, folders, filing cabinets, and even mailboxes to imitate a real office. </td>

			<td>  5 Interacting Types: Instructing - Where users issue instructions to a system. Conversing - Where users have a dialog with a system. Manipulating - Where users interact with objects in a virtual or physical space. Exploring - Where users move through a virtual environment or a physical space. Responding - Where the system initiates the interaction and the user chooses whether to respond. </td>

			<td> <p> Paperback Book v. Ebook - A paperback book is physical while a ebook is electronic so one you can physically touch and the other you will never be able to hold. Even though they are different both still consists of pages you can turn through. While a ebook is untangible you can still mark a page for a later read just like a physical bookmark would for a paperback book. A Paperback Book requires no battery and can be lent/gifted easily but can take up more space, get damaged easily, and is less conventional to store.  The advantages of a ebook is that you can instantly be brought to a specific searched term, highlight text without the use of markers, or adjust the text for easier reading unlike a normal book. A big drawback is the device you're reading on can run out of power so unless you can charge said device your experience is finite. </p>
			<p> Paperback Map v. Smartphone Map - Just like our previous comparison we're dealing with a physical and non-physical item that is instead now used for navigation. Paperback Maps may have a legend/key section to help point out locations, grid, and a scale bar to determine distance between places while a Smartphone Map has zoom in/out functionality, user location, real-time route guidance and pinpoints to areas of interest. When obtaining a Paperback Map there is no way to really interact with what you're given but a Smartphone Map it updates in real-time based on your location, get more details or maybe view/submit reviews and photos on your experience at a certain location. Smartphone Maps though have some functions brought over from their Paperback counterpart like the previous mentioned grids and legends/keys but also they share compass orientation as well. A Paperback Map is more reliable than anything eletronic but is not updated frequently and can take up space. While the Smartphone Map may have many advantages over a traditional map it does run on a finite battery and data that could potential be out of date. Another con is a overreliance on the gudiance system can deteriorate an already low spatial awareness or overwhelm a new user. </p> </td>
