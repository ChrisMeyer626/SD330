		<li>The double diamond approach is a design approach to tackle challenges in four phases. Discover: Designers try to gather insights about the problem. Define: Designers develop a clear brief that frames the design challenge. Develop: Solutions or concepts are made, tested, iterated. Deliver: The resulting project is finalized and launched.</li>
		<li>User-Centered Design: The user knows best and guides the designer. Activity-Centered Design: Concentrates on behavior surrounding a task. System Design: A rigorous and holistic design that focuses on context. Genius Design: Relying largely on the experience and creative flair of a designer. I think the User-Centered Design fits my software development style best. </li>
		<li>Cooperative Design is an overarching design philosophy that places those for whom systems, technologies, and services are being designed, as central actors in creation activities. This also fits in with Agile design process as it's collaborative way of design and developing new products that breaks bigger tasks into groups</li>
		<li>Early focus on users and tasks, Empirical measurements, iterative design.</li>
		<li>Discovering requirements for the interactive product, Designing alternatives that meet those requirements, Prototyping the alternative designs so that they can be communicated and assessed, Evaluating the product and the user experience it offers throughout the process.</li>
		<li>Effectiveness: The streaming app is effective in that it has a large catalogue of updating entertainment content that the user will enjoy. Efficiency: It is efficient in that the app capture all different types of genres without a overwhelming list. Safety: It is safe in that the app has a kids mode for younger audiances and proper login security. Utility: It is helpful in that it can help kill time or bring friends/family together for enjoyable entertainment. Learnability: When first making a account it gives you a tutorial thats hard to forget but the UI being improved over the years is really simple too. Memoriablity: With the updates over the years for the apps popular selections/exclusive content makes it a go to for anyone looking to watch a show/movie.</li>
		<li>User involvement in a development project is a benefit but only depending on what stage of the project they're brought into and how much you involve them. So for example having user involvement for a whole project can lead to a lot of conflict and reworks which may halt the project further. Users may be experts on what they want but not so much when it comes to the specifics of the project and may expect the impossible.</li>
