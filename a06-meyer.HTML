				<div class="cell"> Besides a typical 404 error message the music app spotify has it's own interesting take on the message with showing a image of a record playing until it scratches and stops while displaying the text "404s and heartbreaks" which is a play on words and reference to a famous song. <a href="https://medium.com/@solodev/30-creative-and-clever-404-error-pages-7e39e51bbdf">Interesting 404 Error Messages</a> </div>
